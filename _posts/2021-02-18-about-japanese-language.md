Are you interested in Japan?\
I'm Japanese, so I share Japanese language. 🗾

<!--more-->

I publish [🔗 🎈 Ballon BBS](https://www.telnetbbsguide.com/bbs/ballon-bbs/).\
By writing to this BBS, I found out that many people want to come to Japan.\
Oops, you know that I'm working under the name of [🔗 🎈 BALLOON | FU-SEN](https://github.com/fu-sen).

I will put English and Japanese side by side so that you can know Japanese even a little.\
Similarly, I often watch English channels on YouTube.\
It's especially [🔗 NASA TV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLA_DiR1FfKNvjuUpBHmylQ). 🌏🚀😆

## Japanese Name 日本語の名前

My name is **Keiichi Shiga** . This kanji is **志賀 慶一** . \
Here you should note that the names of Japanese and English are reversed. \
That is: 志賀＝Shiga 慶一＝Keiichi\
Can be in kanji units: 志＝shi 賀＝ga 慶＝kei 一＝ichi\
Usually, one kanji character has its reading.

However, the brand name may not be reversed.\
For example: Hatsune Miku (初音ミク). 初音＝Hatsune ミク＝Miku .
Of course this can also be character-wise: 初＝hatsu 音＝ne ミ＝mi ク＝ku

## Emoji 絵文字

The emoji were originally from Japanese mobile phones and were formulated in Unicode.\
Kanji and reading: 絵＝E(picture) 文字=moji(text)

I like balloons. It's in the emoji: 🎈😄

## Japanese Keyboard 日本語キーボード

![HP Stream 11 Keyboard](/2021/02/keyboard.jpg)

This is the **HP Stream 11** keyboard I'm using.\
You know HP Stream 11, but this keyboard may be unusual.\
There are the following characters for QWER: ぬ ふ あ う\
This is called the JIS(Japanese Industrial Standards) layout\
and has existed in Japanese personal computers for a long time. 💻

![Gboard](/2021/02/gboard.jpg)

I also share the Gboard used on Android. 📱\
Not here: ぬ ふ あ う. How do you enter Japanese?\
The answer was written earlier: hatsunemiku→初音ミク.\
In Japan, flick input(フリック入力) that matches the numeric keypad of mobile phones is also widespread.

## Balloon(s) 風船

![Gboard](/2021/02/balloons.jpg)

I will put out what I like again. It's a **balloon＝風船** .\
But there is a caveat to this: **風船＝🎈**\
Balloon are also for people to ride: <i class="fab fa-fly"></i> It is a **気球** in Japanese.\
気球 comes from Chinese: 气球 or 氣球. In Chinese, it would be the same definition as English.

It's interesting to divide the 風船 by kanji:

- 風(fū or kaze)＝breeze (or wind, But the wind will not be strong)
- 船(sen or fune)＝ship

Yeah. Japanese reading: 風船＝fūsen ("-":Increases pronunciation)

Let's learn another Japanese. Both balloon and balloons are 風船.\
There is no plural form in Japanese.
